This is a valuable resource for finding answers to common questions and understanding team processes.

**Section 3: Core Data Understanding - Key Data Nuances for Analysts**

Understanding our core data is fundamental to your role.  This section highlights *critical data nuances* you'll need to be effective â€“ subtle but impactful behaviors within our datasets.  It's crucial to move beyond simply knowing table and column names and grasp these deeper data characteristics.

**3.1.  Key Data Point: Address Data Nuances**

When working with address data in certain tables, be aware of the following *system logic*:

* **Billing Address Handling:** In the users table of some datasets for you will encounter, the `billing_address` field is designed to be optional. In cases where the `billing_address` field is left empty, system logic dictates that the associated billing address is treated as *identical* to the `shipping_address` recorded in the same record. This is a system design choice to streamline user experience when billing and shipping addresses are the same.  Therefore, do not automatically assume an empty `billing_address` represents missing data. *Always confirm the specific data handling rules for each dataset you are working with, as these nuances can significantly impact your analysis.*

**3.2. Understanding Data Dictionaries and Data Lineage**

* **Data Dictionaries:**  The data dictionary for our Data Warehouse is centrally located and accessible via [Specify location, e.g., "the 'Data Dictionaries' folder on the shared drive", "our internal Data Catalog application"].  This dictionary is your primary reference for understanding data structures, field definitions, data types, and valid value ranges for all tables in our Data Warehouse. Use it frequently!  Your mentor will show you how to navigate and utilize it effectively.
* **Data Lineage:** While detailed data lineage documentation is under development, for critical datasets, you can often find basic lineage information within the ETL tool interface.  Your ETL training will cover how to access and interpret lineage information within [ETL Tool Name].

**3.3.  Products**
* **Product Weight:**  The weight of product is stored in the table with the unit of grams. In our database, it's the table name "p" column "w".

**Section 4: Common BI Operations & Workflows**

This section outlines typical tasks you will perform as a BI Analyst. Step-by-step guides for common operations can be found in the Team Knowledge Base [Specify location, e.g., "the 'BI Team Knowledge Base' in Confluence", "the 'Help' section of our internal reporting portal"].

* **Ad-hoc Report Requests:** Fulfilling report requests from business users. This often involves clarifying requirements, querying data, designing and building reports in our BI platform, and delivering the final report to the requester.  Detailed procedures for handling report requests are documented in the Knowledge Base.
* **Dashboard Maintenance & Enhancement:** Updating and improving existing dashboards. This can include adding new metrics, refining visualizations, optimizing performance, and addressing user feedback.  The dashboard maintenance workflow is outlined in the Knowledge Base.
* **Data Validation & Quality Checks:** Investigating data discrepancies and ensuring data quality. This may involve writing SQL queries to identify data quality issues, collaborating with data engineering to resolve problems, and documenting data quality findings.  Refer to the Data Quality section of the Knowledge Base for procedures and templates.
* **Data Exploration & Proactive Analysis:**  Identifying trends and insights proactively. This encourages you to explore datasets, formulate hypotheses, and uncover potential business opportunities or areas for improvement through data analysis. We encourage you to dedicate a portion of your time each week to proactive data exploration.
* **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing:** Contributing to team knowledge and documentation.  This is crucial for team collaboration and long-term knowledge retention.  You will be expected to document your reports, analyses, and any new data understanding you gain within the Team Knowledge Base.
